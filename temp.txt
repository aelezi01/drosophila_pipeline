1) merge_bams (annotation file) 
-> 
i need to make sure that all samples associated with a certain species are included in the samtools merge command
instead of only including 1 
also need to make sure it picks the correct species for each sample it runs through

2) nextflow test 
->
make sure that including multiple processes the way i have works

3) check how to include module.out as an input in other processes 
-> 
do i need to do " val braker.out " ? 
or just " braker.out "?
or " val  ${species}.bam "

4) should i put all the config paths together in the nf_test script?
->
will it know how to run it?

5) inclusion of python script
->
need to parse the script as a channel or it wont know that i've changed the content of the file 
so:
script1 = Channel.fromPath("script.py")

~
to put together info from different channels using:
channel.combine(file)
	.filter( it[0]["species"] == it[2]["species"]) <- filter only stuff that the have the same value for the variable species
	.map{ [ it[0], it[1] ]}
	.set{ star_input }

process star {
	input:
		tuple val(metadata), val(index), val(fastq)
	shell:

		"""
		STAR $index $ $fastq
		"""
