there's 2 ways i can organise this.

1) use multiprocessing
2) use snakemake

the problem with snakemake is that i think it will take a lot of extra coding to set it up so that it can do what i need it to do.

the problem with multiprocessing is that i would have ot write a file myself for keeping track of software versions etc
HOWEVER, i kind of already keep track of them bc there's an ML MODULE in every bash file. 
so then there isnt really any problems. 
the only obstacle is to check whether it would wait for sbatch to finish running the bash file before it goes on to the next multiprocesing loop.
snakemake knows hoe to wait. multiprocessing knows how to wait for python commands, not sure about bash (/sbatch) scripts.
